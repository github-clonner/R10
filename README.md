## Project
This is an Android/iOS app for a web developer conference. The objective of this project is to build an app using React Native.

## Technology
* Visual Studio Code Text Editor
* XCode
* Android Studio
* React Native
* Redux
* React Native Maps
* Javascript/JSX
* Command Line Interface
* Git/Github

## Learning Experience
This was my first time developing without using HTML or CSS but I was quick to learn how to use View, Text, Image, etc. I feel that styling is much more easier compared to desktop sites because I only have to worry about mobile size. Data for the Code of Conduct, Sessions and Speakers was pulled from Firebase using Redux Thunk. I used the Realm database to store favourite sessions. The Map scene was made using Airbnb's React Native Maps. After working with Google Maps React in the Shared Spot App, implementing this feature was a breeze. I used ExNavigation as a weapon of choice for navigating.

I enjoyed working with React Native. I can't wait to work with it some more.
